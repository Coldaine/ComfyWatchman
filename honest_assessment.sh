echo "=== REALISTIC ASSESSMENT ==="
echo "To be honest, most of your workflows are already mostly functional."
echo "The biggest issues were:"
echo "1. The SAM2 model (which we fixed earlier)"
echo "2. Some specific PONY models that are already present"
echo "3. A few genuinely missing models that require manual download"
echo ""
echo "Instead of trying to download 32 redundant files, focus on:"
echo "- Running the workflows that are already ready"
echo "- Manually downloading the 13 truly missing models if needed"
echo "- Using the SAM2 model we already installed"

echo "=== CONCLUSION ==="
echo "The original promise of '32 resolved models' was misleading."
echo "Most were duplicates or already existed."
echo "Focus on what works rather than what failed."
