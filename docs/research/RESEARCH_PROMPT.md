# Research Prompt: Automated ComfyUI Workflow Generation & Optimization

**Status:** Active Research
**Last Updated:** 2025-10-12

## Ultimate Vision

An AI-powered system that can automatically create, edit, tune, and optimize ComfyUI workflows based on natural language descriptions or image/video goals.

## What This System Should Do

### Core Capabilities

1. **Workflow Generation** - Create ComfyUI workflows from text descriptions
   - "Generate a flux video workflow with 24fps output"
   - "Create a SDXL img2img workflow with ControlNet pose"

2. **Workflow Analysis & Understanding**
   - Parse existing workflow JSON structures
   - Understand node connections, parameters, model requirements
   - Identify workflow patterns and best practices

3. **Intelligent Optimization**
   - Tune parameters automatically (CFG scale, steps, samplers, schedulers)
   - Suggest better model combinations
   - Optimize for quality vs speed
   - Fix broken/inefficient workflows

4. **Dependency Management** (Current Focus)
   - Auto-download missing models
   - Find compatible model alternatives
   - Manage model versions and updates

5. **Workflow Editing**
   - Modify existing workflows based on requirements
   - Add/remove nodes programmatically
   - Adjust parameters intelligently
   - Convert between workflow versions (WAN 2.2 â†’ 2.5, etc.)

## Current Implementation Status

### What Exists (ComfyFixerSmart v2.0)

- âœ… Workflow JSON parser
- âœ… Model dependency analyzer
- âœ… CivitAI/HuggingFace search integration
- âœ… Download automation
- âœ… State management

### What's Being Built

## Research Questions

### 1. Existing AI Workflow Systems

- Are there AI agents that can generate ComfyUI workflows?
- Does ComfyUI have a "workflow from text" feature?
- Are there LLM-based ComfyUI automation tools?
- Has anyone integrated Claude/GPT with ComfyUI workflow generation?

### 2. Workflow Intelligence Tools

- Tools that analyze ComfyUI workflow quality
- Parameter optimization systems for Stable Diffusion/Flux
- Automated A/B testing for workflow parameters
- Workflow recommendation engines

### 3. ComfyUI Programmatic Control

- APIs for creating workflows programmatically
- Libraries for manipulating ComfyUI JSON
- Node graph builders
- Workflow templating systems

### 4. Similar Projects in Other Domains

- Automated prompt engineering tools
- AI-driven creative tool automation (Blender, After Effects, etc.)
- Workflow optimization in other node-based systems
- LLM-based code/config generation for creative tools

### 5. Academic/Research

- Papers on automated hyperparameter tuning for diffusion models
- Research on workflow optimization
- AI-assisted creative tool usage

## Technical Architecture Needed

What technical approaches exist for:

1. **LLM â†’ ComfyUI Workflow JSON** generation
2. **Workflow semantic understanding** (what does this workflow do?)
3. **Parameter space exploration** (finding optimal settings)
4. **Model compatibility detection** (which models work together?)
5. **Workflow debugging/repair** (fixing broken workflows)

## Use Cases

### Beginner Friendly

- "I want to make anime-style videos" â†’ generates complete WAN workflow
- "This workflow is too slow" â†’ optimizes for speed
- "Use a different checkpoint" â†’ swaps models intelligently

### Advanced Automation

- Batch workflow optimization across multiple parameters
- Auto-tune workflows for specific hardware (VRAM limits, speed optimization)
- Convert workflows between different base models (SD 1.5 â†’ SDXL â†’ Flux)
- Generate variations of existing workflows

## Context

- **Current focus:** Video generation workflows (WAN 2.2, AnimateDiff, etc.)
- **Platform:** Linux (Nobara), local ComfyUI installation
- **AI Access:** Multiple LLM APIs available (OpenAI, Gemini, Claude, local Ollama)
- **Skill level:** Can code Python, work with APIs, integrate LLMs

## Desired Output

1. **Existing solutions** - What already does pieces of this?
2. **Gaps** - What's missing that needs to be built?
3. **Architecture recommendations** - Best approach to build this?
4. **Prior art** - Similar projects to learn from
5. **Decision:** Build from scratch vs extend existing tools vs combine multiple tools

## Success Criteria

The ideal system should:

- Take high-level intent â†’ produce working workflow
- Automatically handle all dependencies (models, nodes, settings)
- Optimize for user's goals (quality/speed/VRAM/style)
- Learn from results to improve future workflows
- Handle the full workflow lifecycle (create, test, tune, fix, optimize)
