# LangGraph Research Prompt - October 2025

> **Context:** LangGraph recently underwent a major refactor. This research prompt is designed to gather comprehensive information about current capabilities, best practices, and architectural patterns for building a multi-agent workflow automation system.

---

## üéØ Research Objective

Gather authoritative, up-to-date documentation on LangGraph (post-October 2025 refactor) to inform the design of **ComfyWatchman** - an intelligent, multi-agent system that monitors, analyzes, and maintains ComfyUI workflows autonomously.

---

## üìã System Requirements Context

Before researching, understand what we're building:

### High-Level Architecture
- **Scheduled orchestration:** Agents run every 2 hours to check workflow health
- **Multi-agent coordination:** Multiple specialist agents working in parallel
- **Human-in-the-loop:** Approval gates for downloads and uncertain decisions
- **State persistence:** Long-running state across system restarts
- **Privacy-first:** All data stored locally, no cloud dependencies

### Agent Types Needed
1. **System Health Agent** - Checks VRAM, ComfyUI status (fast, parallel-safe)
2. **Workflow Scanner Agent** - Parses workflow JSON files (parallel per workflow)
3. **Model Inventory Agent** - Scans ComfyUI directories (parallel per model type)
4. **Dependency Resolver Agent** - Matches requirements to inventory (sequential after scan)
5. **Agentic Search Agent** - Uses Qwen LLM to search Civitai/HuggingFace (parallel per model)
6. **Workflow Explainer Agent** - LLM generates human explanations (parallel per workflow)
7. **Report Generator Agent** - Aggregates results into reports (sequential, final step)

### Critical Capabilities Required
- ‚úÖ Parallel agent execution (independent workflows scanned simultaneously)
- ‚úÖ Conditional routing (skip if VRAM low, retry on errors)
- ‚úÖ State checkpointing (resume after system restart)
- ‚úÖ Human approval interrupts (pause for user input with timeout)
- ‚úÖ Tool calling (wrap existing Python utilities as agent tools)
- ‚úÖ Local-only persistence (JSON files, SQLite - no cloud)
- ‚úÖ Agent isolation (one agent failure doesn't crash others)
- ‚úÖ Audit trails (log every decision and tool call)
