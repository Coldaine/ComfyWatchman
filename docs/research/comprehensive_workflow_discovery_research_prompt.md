# Comprehensive Research Prompt: ComfyUI Workflow Discovery Methods

## Mission Statement

**Primary Objective**: Identify ALL viable methods for discovering and obtaining ComfyUI workflows that use specific models/LoRAs, with focus on Civitai as the primary platform.

**Secondary Objective**: Document the complete workflow sharing ecosystem - where workflows are hosted, how they're shared, what formats they use, and how to systematically discover them.

**Use Case**: We need to find existing workflows using "Perfect Fingering - WAN 2.2 I2V" LoRA (Civitai model 1952032) as a test case, but the methodology should work for ANY model/LoRA.

## Research Scope

### Part 1: Civitai Platform Deep Dive

#### 1.1 Image Format and Metadata Investigation
**Research Questions**:
- What image formats does Civitai accept for upload? (PNG, JPEG, WebP, etc.)
- What formats does Civitai serve via their CDN (image.civitai.com)?
- Does Civitai preserve PNG metadata chunks (tEXt, iTXt, zTXt)?
- If conversion happens, at what point? (Upload, storage, serving, CDN caching?)
- Are there URL parameters to request original format? (`?original=true`, `?format=png`, `?quality=100`)
- Do different Civitai features preserve metadata differently? (Gallery vs Resources vs Model showcase)

  YES → Try Method A: Civitai Workflow Search
    ├─ Found ≥4? → SUCCESS
    └─ Found <4? → Try Method B: Creator Analysis
  NO → Try Method F: GitHub Search

Q2: Did creator publish workflows?
  YES → Download and verify
  NO → Try Method C: Community Search

Q3: Are there related/generic workflows?
  YES → Document integration method
  NO → Try Method D: Request from community

FALLBACK: Create example workflow + integration guide
```

### 4. Automation Recommendations

Based on findings, recommend which methods to implement in `batch_workflow_finder.py`:

**Priority 1 (Must Have)**:
- [Method X]: [Why] - [Implementation complexity: Easy/Medium/Hard]

**Priority 2 (Should Have)**:
- [Method Y]: [Why] - [Implementation complexity]

**Priority 3 (Nice to Have)**:
- [Method Z]: [Why] - [Implementation complexity]

**Not Worth Implementing**:
- [Method W]: [Why not] - [Alternative approach]

### 5. Updated Documentation

Provide updated text for `docs/plans/FindingWorkflows.md`:
- Correct any false assumptions
- Add newly discovered methods
- Update "What Works" and "What Doesn't Work" sections
- Add platform-specific quirks and workarounds

### 6. Actionable Next Steps

Based on research, provide:
1. **Immediate Actions** (can do today)
2. **Short-term Actions** (this week)
3. **Long-term Actions** (this month)
4. **Not Recommended** (waste of time based on findings)

For the specific Perfect Fingering use case:
- Can we find 4 workflows? **YES/NO**
- If yes, using which method(s)?
- If no, what's the best alternative?

## Research Quality Standards
