# Z.AI Provider Documentation

## Overview

This document contains information about the Z.AI provider endpoint and its requirements for integration with ComfyFixerSmart.

## Endpoint Information

- **Endpoint URL**: `https://api.z.ai/api/coding/paas/v4`
- **Purpose**: All LLM endpoints need to be compatible with this provider
- **API Format**: Research needed to determine if it uses the new OpenAI API endpoint format

## Research Requirements

### Endpoint Formatting Research

- [ ] Determine if the Z.AI endpoint uses the new OpenAI API endpoint format
- [ ] Document the request/response structure
- [ ] Identify authentication requirements
- [ ] Document any custom headers or parameters needed

### Endpoint Capabilities Research

- [ ] Identify supported models and their capabilities
- [ ] Document rate limits and usage quotas
- [ ] Research supported content types (text, images, etc.)
- [ ] Determine streaming vs non-streaming response support
- [ ] Document any special features or limitations

### Integration Research

- [ ] Research compatibility with existing ComfyFixerSmart architecture
- [ ] Identify any required modifications to current search backends
- [ ] Document configuration requirements
- [ ] Research error handling and retry mechanisms

## Research Progress

### Completed
- [x] Initial documentation structure created
- [x] Basic endpoint information documented

### In Progress
- [ ] Endpoint formatting research
- [ ] Endpoint capabilities research
- [ ] Integration research

### Next Steps
1. Research the Z.AI endpoint API documentation
2. Test endpoint compatibility with OpenAI API format
3. Document all findings in this file
4. Update implementation based on research results

## Implementation Notes

This section will be updated as research progresses.
