# Phase 3 Integration Plan: Extended LLM + RAG Vision

> **STATUS:** DEFERRED - Do not implement until Phases 1 & 2 complete and owner approves

## Overview
Optional integration of vector embeddings, semantic search, and advanced RAG workflows for workflow comparison, optimization recommendations, and automated variant generation.

## Architecture Decisions (Pending)

### Vector Store Selection
**Options:**
- ChromaDB (lightweight, local, persistent)
- FAISS (fast, in-memory, requires save/load)
- Qdrant (full-featured, can run locally)

**Evaluation Criteria:**
- Local-only operation (no cloud)
- Privacy guarantees
- Performance for 100-1000 workflows
- Integration with LangGraph

### Embedding Model Selection
**Options:**
- `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` (lightweight, fast)
- `bge-small-en-v1.5` (better quality)
- `gte-large` (highest quality, slower)

**Requirements:**
- Local inference only
- <500MB model size
- <100ms per embedding

## New Capabilities (Deferred)

### 3.1: Semantic Workflow Search
**Query:** "Find workflows similar to turbo-upscale-x4.json"
**Process:**
1. Embed target workflow (structure + purpose)
2. Search vector store
3. Return top-K similar workflows with explanations

### 3.2: Automated Optimization Suggestions
**Query:** "Optimize workflow for 8GB VRAM"
**Process:**
1. Retrieve similar workflows from vector store
2. Analyze parameter differences
3. Suggest modifications with trade-off analysis

### 3.3: Regression Detection
**Compare:** workflow-v1.json vs. workflow-v2.json
**Outputs:**
- Parameter diffs
- VRAM usage change estimate
- Quality impact prediction

## Research Required (Phase 3 Kickoff)

- [ ] Benchmark vector stores for local performance
- [ ] Evaluate embedding models for workflow similarity
- [ ] Test RAG retrieval quality with 50+ workflows
- [ ] Measure privacy guarantees (no data egress)

## Success Criteria (To Be Defined)

- TBD after Phase 1 & 2 complete
- Owner approval required before implementation
