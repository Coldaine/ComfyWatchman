# Documentation Review and Consolidation Plan

**Date:** 2025-10-29
**Status:** Final Recommendation

## 1. Executive Summary

This document contains the final recommendations from a comprehensive review of all Markdown files in the project. The documentation is incredibly thorough but has grown organically, leading to duplication, outdated files, and a structure that can be confusing for newcomers.

The recommendations below aim to streamline the documentation by creating a clear, logical structure that separates user-facing guides, developer documentation, strategic plans, and historical archives. This will significantly improve navigability and maintainability.

## 2. High-Level Observations

*   **Duplication of Effort:** There are multiple documents covering the same topics, such as architecture, migration plans, and AI agent instructions.
*   **Historical Artifacts:** Many files are valuable historical records of the project's evolution (e.g., specific PR comparisons, logs, old plans) but are currently mixed in with "living" documentation.
*   **Unclear Structure:** The distinction between some directories is blurry (e.g., `docs/planning` vs. `docs/plans`), and many development-related artifacts clutter the main `docs` tree.

---

## 3. Recommendations for Merging & Consolidation

The primary goal of this section is to create a "single source of truth" for key topics.

### 3.1. User-Facing Documentation
**Goal:** Consolidate all guides for end-users into a single, easy-to-navigate location.
*   **Action:** Create a new **`docs/user-guide/`** directory.
*   **Merge the following into `docs/user-guide/`:**
    *   All content from `docs/user/`
    *   All content from `docs/usage/`
    *   `docs/technical/faq.md`
    *   The brief `docs/tools/model_inspector.md` should be merged into the more detailed `inspect.md` within this new directory.
    *   The `INSTALL.md` from the root directory.

### 3.2. Strategic & Architectural Documentation
**Goal:** Group all high-level planning, vision, and architecture documents together.
*   **Action:** Create a new **`docs/strategy/`** directory.
*   **Move the following into `docs/strategy/`:**
    *   `docs/vision.md`
    *   `docs/CROSSROADS.md`
    *   All files from `docs/truth/` (`FutureFileTree.md`, `Pathforward.md`)
*   **Action:** Consolidate the three roadmap documents (`COMPREHENSIVE_ROADMAP.md`, `EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md`, `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`) into a single, authoritative **`docs/strategy/ROADMAP.md`**.
*   **Action:** Consolidate the multiple architecture documents. Create a new **`docs/architecture/`** directory containing:
    *   `current.md` (based on `docs/developer/architecture.md`)
    *   `vision.md` (based on the future-facing `docs/architecture.md`)

### 3.3. Developer & Contributor Documentation
**Goal:** Streamline guides for developers and AI agents.
*   **Action:** Consolidate all AI agent instructions into a single file: **`docs/developer/ai-agent-guide.md`**.
*   **Merge the following into `ai-agent-guide.md`:**
    *   `AGENTS.md` (from root)
    *   `CLAUDE.md` (from root)
    *   `docs/planning/AGENT_GUIDE.md`
    *   `docs/playbooks/model-resolution-playbook.md`
*   **Action:** Move the valuable research document `docs/developer/workflow_tooling_guide.md` to **`docs/research/`**.

### 3.4. Internal Planning Documents
**Goal:** Unify the location for internal planning, prompts, and design documents.
*   **Action:** Consolidate all planning-related materials into the **`docs/planning/`** directory.
*   **Merge the following into `docs/planning/`:**
    *   All content from `docs/plans/`
    *   All content from `docs/prompts/`

---

## 4. Recommendations for Deletion & Archiving

**Goal:** Move historical, temporary, or non-documentation files out of the main documentation tree to reduce clutter.
*   **Action:** Create a new top-level **`archives/`** directory to store all historical files.

### 4.1. Archive Historical Project Files
*   **Action:** Create `archives/project-history/` and move the following files into it:
    *   `PR_COMPARISON.md`
    *   `REQUIREMENTS.md`
    *   `CLEANUP_SUMMARY.md`
    *   `due_diligence_plan.md`
    *   All migration-related guides (after consolidating them into a single guide).

### 4.2. Archive Development & Process Artifacts
*   **Action:** Create relevant subdirectories inside `archives/` for the following:
    *   `archives/reviews/`: Move `docs/review/AGENT_TOOLING_REVIEW.md` here.
    *   `archives/test-logs/`: Move `docs/testing/2025-10-19-download-test-results.md` here.
    *   `archives/incident-reports/`: Move `docs/reports/civitai-api-wrong-metadata-incident.md` and `docs/reports/python312_migration_log.md` here.
    *   `archives/design/`: Move `docs/ui/FIGMA_PROMPTS.md` here.
    *   `archives/discussions/`: Move `docs/dumps/discussion.md` here.
    *   `archives/legacy-tools/`: Move the contents of the current `archives/` directory here.

### 4.3. Reclassify Reports as Examples
*   **Goal:** Use detailed analysis reports as showcases of the tool's capabilities.
*   **Action:** Move the workflow analysis reports to the new user guide directory:
    *   `docs/reports/WAN22_POV_MISSION_ANALYSIS.md` -> `docs/user-guide/examples/wan22_mission_analysis.md`
    *   `docs/reports/WAN22_POV_MISSIONARY_ANALYSIS.md` -> `docs/user-guide/examples/wan22_missionary_analysis.md`
    *   `docs/reports/workflow_validation_report.md` -> `docs/user-guide/examples/validation_report_example.md`

### 4.4. Delete Empty or Redundant Files
*   **Action:** Delete the now-empty stub file `docs/research/ZAI_PROVIDER.md`.

## 5. Conclusion

By implementing these changes, the project's documentation will be transformed from a sprawling collection of historical and current files into a clean, well-structured, and maintainable knowledge base. This will provide clear paths for different audiences:
*   **Users:** Will have a single, consolidated `docs/user-guide/`.
*   **Developers:** Will find relevant technical guides in `docs/developer/` and `docs/architecture/`.
*   **Strategists/Architects:** Will have a clear view of the project's direction in `docs/strategy/`.
*   **Historians:** Can explore the project's evolution in the `archives/` directory.
