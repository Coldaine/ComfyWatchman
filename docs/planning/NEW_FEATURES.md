# New Features - Enhanced ComfyFixer

## 1. Smart Caching System ✓

**File**: `output/found_models_cache.json`

### How It Works:
- First search for a model → Saves result to cache
- Next run → Skips re-searching, uses cached result
- **Saves time**: Only search once per model ever!

### Example:
```
Run 1: Searches for rife49.pth (takes 1.7 min) → Caches result
Run 2: Skips rife49.pth (instant) → Searches remaining models
```

### Benefits:
- ✅ Resume interrupted searches
- ✅ Re-run script without wasting time
- ✅ Test with subsets of models
- ✅ Manually add known models to cache

### Cache Management:
```bash
# View cache
cat output/found_models_cache.json

# Clear entire cache (re-search everything)
rm output/found_models_cache.json

# Edit cache manually
nano output/found_models_cache.json
```

## 2. Interactive Confirmation Step ✓

### After Search Completes:
```
==========================================================
SEARCH RESULTS - Please Review
==========================================================

**[v] - View Logs**
- Shows path to detailed search logs
- Review Qwen's reasoning for each search

### Benefits:
- ✅ Review before downloading
- ✅ Catch incorrect matches
- ✅ Remove bad cache entries
- ✅ Understand search decisions

## 3. Comprehensive Search Logging ✓

**File**: `log/qwen_search_history.log`

### What Gets Logged:
```
================================================================================
SEARCH LOG: 2025-10-12 06:30:49
================================================================================
Model: rife49.pth
Type: upscale_models
Node: UpscaleModelLoader
Elapsed: 104.4s

RESULT: FOUND
Source: huggingface

QWEN OUTPUT:
[QWEN] Extracting keywords from "rife49.pth"...
[QWEN] Keywords: ["rife", "49"]
[QWEN] Civitai query "rife49" → 0 results
[QWEN] Moving to HuggingFace search...
[QWEN] Found rife49.pth on HuggingFace
...
```

### Use Cases:
```bash
# View all searches
cat log/qwen_search_history.log

# Find specific model
grep "rife49" log/qwen_search_history.log -A 20

# Count successes
grep "RESULT: FOUND" log/qwen_search_history.log | wc -l

# See HuggingFace finds
grep "Source: huggingface" log/qwen_search_history.log
```

## 4. Improved Progress Tracking ✓

### During Search:
```
=== STEP 5: Searching for Models ===
  Loaded 1 previously found models from cache
  ✓ Using cached result for: rife49.pth
    Source: huggingface
  [1/20] Searching: sam_vit_b_01ec64.pth
  Launching Qwen search for: sam_vit_b_01ec64.pth
  ...

Search Summary:
  Cached: 1
  Searched: 20
  Found: 15
  Not Found: 5
```

Shows:
- Which models are cached
- Current search progress (1/20, 2/20...)
- Final summary statistics

## Usage Examples

### First Run (No Cache):
```bash
python3 comfy_fixer.py

# Output:
# === STEP 5: Searching for Models ===
# [1/21] Searching: hunyuan_pov_cowgirlposition_V3.safetensors
# ... (takes ~36 minutes for 21 models)
#
# SEARCH RESULTS - Please Review
# [y/n/e/v]: y
#
# ✓ Ready to Download!
# Run: bash output/download_missing.sh
```

### Second Run (With Cache):
```bash
python3 comfy_fixer.py

# Output:
# === STEP 5: Searching for Models ===
# Loaded 15 previously found models from cache
# ✓ Using cached result for: rife49.pth (instant)
# ✓ Using cached result for: sam_vit_b_01ec64.pth (instant)
# ... (15 cached, 6 new searches = ~10 minutes)
#
# SEARCH RESULTS - Please Review
# [y/n/e/v]: _
```

### Fixing Bad Cache Entry:
```bash
python3 comfy_fixer.py

# After search completes:
# [y/n/e/v]: e

# Cached models that will be SKIPPED on next run:
#   [1] rife49.pth
#   [2] bad_model.safetensors (wrong result!)
#   [3] sam_vit_b_01ec64.pth
#
# Enter model number to remove from cache: 2
# Removed bad_model.safetensors from cache
#
# [y/n/e/v]: n  (exit and re-run)
```

## Performance Improvements

### Time Comparison:

**Without Cache** (first run):
```
21 models × ~1.7 min/model = ~36 minutes
```

**With Cache** (subsequent runs):
```
Cached: 15 models (instant)
New: 6 models × 1.7 min = ~10 minutes
Total: ~10 minutes (71% faster!)
```

### Space Usage:
```
Cache file: ~2-5 KB (negligible)
Search logs: ~50 KB per run (grows over time)
```

## Troubleshooting

### Cache is Wrong:
```bash
# Option 1: Remove from interactive menu
python3 comfy_fixer.py
# Choose [e] then remove bad entry

# Option 2: Clear entire cache
rm output/found_models_cache.json

# Option 3: Edit manually
nano output/found_models_cache.json
```

### Search Failed:
```bash
# Check search logs
tail -100 log/qwen_search_history.log

# Find specific model
grep "model_name.safetensors" log/qwen_search_history.log -A 30
```

### Want to Re-search Everything:
```bash
# Clear cache and logs
rm output/found_models_cache.json
rm log/qwen_search_history.log

# Run fresh search
python3 comfy_fixer.py
```

## What's Next?

Now ready to run:
```bash
python3 comfy_fixer.py
```

It will:
1. Find 21 missing models
2. Use cached result for rife49.pth (instant)
3. Search for remaining 20 models (~34 min)
4. Show interactive confirmation
5. Generate download script
6. You download models!
