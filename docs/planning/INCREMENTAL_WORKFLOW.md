# Incremental Workflow - Complete Redesign

## 🎯 Problem Solved

**OLD workflow had critical flaws:**
1. ❌ **Caching preserved failures** - If we couldn't find a model, cache ensured we'd never try again
2. ❌ **Batch processing** - Had to wait for ALL searches before ANY downloads
3. ❌ **Manual execution** - User had to run download script manually
4. ❌ **No verification** - Never checked if downloads actually worked
5. ❌ **Poor feedback** - No progress visibility until completion

## ✅ NEW Incremental Workflow

### One Model at a Time

```
FOR EACH missing model:
  1. Search with Qwen (~1.7 min)
  2. IF FOUND:
     a. Generate download_001_modelname.sh
     b. Execute download IMMEDIATELY
     c. Increment counter
     d. IF counter % 6 == 0:
        └─ Verify last 6 models with Qwen
  3. IF NOT FOUND:
     └─ Log failure, continue
```

### Key Features

**🚀 Immediate Downloads**
- Downloads start as soon as each model is found
- No waiting for all searches to complete
- Downloads run while next search happens

**♻️ No Caching = Always Fresh**
- Every run searches from scratch
- No preserved failures
- Models that appear later will be found

**✅ Built-in Verification**
- Qwen checks files exist every 6 downloads
- Verifies file size (not corrupted)
- Logs verification results

**📊 Real-time Progress**
- See each model as it's processed
- Know immediately if search fails
- Watch downloads complete live

**🐛 Individual Download Scripts**
- `output/download_001_rife49.sh`
- `output/download_002_sam_vit.sh`
- Easy to debug/retry individual models

## Usage

```bash
cd /home/coldaine/StableDiffusionWorkflow/ComfyFixerSmart
python3 comfy_fixer.py
```

### Workflow Execution

1. **Scan Phase** (instant)
   ```
   === STEP 1: Scanning workflows ===
   === STEP 3: Generating missing list ===
   Total missing models: 21
   ```

2. **Confirmation**
   ```
   ============================================================
   INCREMENTAL WORKFLOW - Ready to Start
   ============================================================
   Missing models: 21

   This workflow will:
     1. Search for each model individually (no caching)
     2. Download immediately after finding each model
     3. Verify downloads every 6 models with Qwen
     4. Continue until all models processed

   Your choice [y/n/v]: y
   ```

3. **Incremental Processing**
   ```
   [1/21] Processing: rife49.pth
     Launching Qwen search...
     ✓ Found on HuggingFace: AlexWortega/RIFE
     Generated: download_001_rife49_pth.sh
     Executing download: download_001_rife49_pth.sh
     ✓ Download completed successfully

   [2/21] Processing: sam_vit_b_01ec64.pth
     Launching Qwen search...
     ✓ Found on HuggingFace: facebook/sam-vit-base
     Generated: download_002_sam_vit_b_01ec64_pth.sh
     Executing download: download_002_sam_vit_b_01ec64_pth.sh
     ✓ Download completed successfully

   ...

   [6/21] Processing: model006.pth
     ✓ Download completed successfully

   ============================================================
   Verifying last 6 downloads with Qwen
   ============================================================
     ✓ Verified: 6 models

   [7/21] Processing: model007.pth
   ...
   ```

4. **Final Summary**
   ```
   ============================================================
   INCREMENTAL DOWNLOAD SUMMARY
   ============================================================
     Total models: 21
     Successfully downloaded: 18
     Failed searches: 2
     Failed downloads: 1
     Download scripts created: 18

   Models not found:
     - obscure_model_v3.safetensors
     - deleted_lora.safetensors

   Download failures:
     - timeout_model.ckpt
   ```

```

## Performance

**Time Per Model:**
- Search: ~1.7 min (Qwen)
- Download: Parallel with next search
- Verification: ~2 min per batch of 6

**Total Time (21 models):**
- Sequential searches: ~36 min
- Downloads: Overlap with searches
- Verifications: ~6 min (4 batches of 6)
- **Effective total: ~42 min**

## Benefits Over Old Workflow

| Feature | Old (Batch) | New (Incremental) |
|---------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Download start** | After ALL searches | After EACH search |
| **Progress visibility** | None until end | Real-time per model |
| **Caching** | Yes (preserves failures) | No (always fresh) |
| **Verification** | Optional (Claude) | Built-in (Qwen) |
| **Resume capability** | No | Yes (counter persists) |
| **Debug-ability** | One big script | Individual scripts |
| **Failure handling** | Lose everything | Continue others |

## Download Counter

The counter persists across runs via `output/download_counter.txt`:

```bash
# First run
download_001_model1.sh
download_002_model2.sh
download_003_model3.sh

# Second run (counter continues)
download_004_new_model.sh
download_005_another.sh
```

**Why?**
- Never overwrite previous download scripts
- Easy to track all downloads ever made
- Can manually re-run any specific download

## Verification Details

Every 6 downloads, Qwen runs this check:

```python
FILES TO CHECK:
  1. /path/to/models/upscale_models/rife49.pth
  2. /path/to/models/checkpoints/sam_vit_b.pth
  ...

For each file:
1. Check if the file exists
2. Get the file size in MB
3. Verify it's not corrupted (size > 1MB)

OUTPUT:
{
  "verified": [
    {"filename": "rife49.pth", "exists": true, "size_mb": 67, "status": "ok"},
    ...
  ],
  "failed": [
    {"filename": "broken.pth", "exists": false, "status": "missing"}
  ]
}
```

**Verification catches:**
- ✅ Files that didn't download
- ✅ Corrupted/truncated downloads (size too small)
- ✅ Permission issues
- ✅ Wrong paths

## Error Recovery

**Search failures:**
- Logged to qwen_search_history.log
- Model skipped, workflow continues
- Listed in final summary

**Download failures:**
- Logged with error details
- Script preserved for manual retry
- Listed in final summary

**Verification failures:**
- Logged with file details
- Does NOT stop workflow
- User can manually investigate

## Comparison Example

**OLD batch workflow (21 models):**
```
1. Search 21 models         [~36 min]
2. Show results
3. User confirms
4. Generate ONE script      [instant]
5. User runs script         [manual, ~30 min]
6. No verification

Total: ~66 min + manual steps
```

**NEW incremental workflow (21 models):**
```
1. User confirms            [instant]
2. Search + Download + Verify all [~42 min, automatic]
3. Done!

Total: ~42 min, fully automatic
```

**Savings:** ~24 minutes + eliminated manual steps!

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
- [ ] Parallel downloads (run 3 downloads simultaneously)
- [ ] Retry failed downloads automatically
- [ ] Export verification report
- [ ] Web dashboard for progress monitoring
- [ ] Email/notification on completion
