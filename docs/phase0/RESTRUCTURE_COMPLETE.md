# Repository Restructure Summary

This document confirms the successful completion of the Phase 0 repository restructure, executed on 2025-10-30.

## Summary of Actions

1.  **Code Archival:**
    *   The entire `src/`, `civitai_tools/`, and `legacy/` directories from the previous codebase were moved to `archives/original-codebase-2025-10-30/`. This preserves the old CLI-centric implementation for historical reference while removing it from the active codebase.

2.  **Documentation Overhaul:**
    *   The entire legacy `docs/` directory was deleted.
    *   The only preserved documents were `docs/strategy/vision.md` and `docs/research/EXISTING_SYSTEMS.md`, which were moved into the new structure.

3.  **New Directory Structure:**
    *   A new, clean directory structure was created in `src/comfywatchman/` to house the future LangGraph-based implementation, including dedicated folders for `core`, `agents`, `tools`, `knowledge`, and `state`.
    *   A new documentation structure was created under `docs/` with organized directories for `strategy`, `research`, and phases `0` through `3`.

## Rationale for Removals

*   **Old Source Code (`src/`, `civitai_tools/`, `legacy/`):** The previous implementation was tightly coupled to a CLI orchestration model. The vision reboot requires a fundamental shift to a LangGraph-orchestrated intelligent workflow assistant. Instead of a complex and potentially incomplete refactoring, a clean rewrite was chosen to ensure full alignment with the new architecture.

*   **Old Documentation (`docs/`):** The previous documentation was extensive but largely irrelevant to the new vision. It described CLI workflows, ad-hoc design notes, and implementation details for features that are now deprecated. Removing it wholesale prevents confusion and ensures that the new, vision-aligned documentation is the single source of truth.

The repository is now in a clean state, ready for the implementation of the new vision as outlined in the phase-based integration plans.
