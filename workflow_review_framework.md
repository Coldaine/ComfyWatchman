# ComfyUI Workflow Review Framework

## Purpose
This framework provides a standardized approach for reviewing, analyzing, and maintaining ComfyUI workflow files to ensure they are functional, well-documented, and optimized for their intended hardware targets.

## Review Framework Structure

### 1. Structural Analysis
- **File Integrity**: Verify JSON structure is valid and uncorrupted
- **Node Completeness**: Ensure all referenced models/nodes are documented or available
- **Workflow Logic**: Check for logical execution paths and proper node connections
- **Metadata**: Validate that workflow contains proper authorship and usage information

### 2. Technical Assessment
- **Model Dependencies**: Identify all required model files (checkpoints, LoRAs, VAEs, etc.)
- **Custom Node Requirements**: List all required custom nodes and their source repositories
- **Hardware Requirements**: Estimate VRAM usage and processing time based on workflow complexity
- **Performance Optimization**: Identify potential bottlenecks and optimization opportunities

### 3. Functional Validation
- **Execution Readiness**: Determine if workflow can run given current environment
- **Error Handling**: Check for potential failure points and graceful degradation
- **Output Quality**: Assess expected output quality based on configuration
- **Scalability**: Evaluate performance changes with different input parameters

### 4. Documentation Standards
- **Usage Instructions**: Clear guidance on how to use the workflow
- **Prerequisites**: Complete list of required models and custom nodes
- **Parameter Explanations**: Description of key adjustable parameters
- **Troubleshooting Guide**: Common issues and solutions

## Review Categories & Scoring

### Completeness Score (0-10)
- 9-10: Fully functional with comprehensive documentation
- 6-8: Functional but missing some documentation or optimizations
- 3-5: Requires significant fixes or missing critical dependencies
- 0-2: Non-functional and requires complete reconstruction

### Complexity Rating
- **Simple**: Single model, few parameters, <1GB VRAM
- **Moderate**: Multiple models, configurable parameters, 1-4GB VRAM
- **Complex**: Multiple stages, custom nodes, 4-12GB VRAM
- **Advanced**: Multi-stage processing, specialized techniques, >12GB VRAM

### Hardware Target Classification
- **Consumer**: GTX 10xx, RTX 20xx, low-end cards
- **Mid-range**: RTX 30xx, RTX 4060/70, equivalent AMD cards
- **High-end**: RTX 3080/3090, RTX 4080/4090, workstation cards
- **Professional**: Multi-GPU, workstation configurations

## Review Process

### Phase 1: Automated Scanning
1. Validate JSON structure
2. Identify all model and node dependencies
3. Calculate estimated VRAM requirements
4. Check for common configuration issues

### Phase 2: Manual Assessment
1. Verify workflow logic and execution flow
2. Test with sample inputs if possible
3. Document findings and recommendations
4. Assign scores and classifications

### Phase 3: Documentation
1. Create/update workflow metadata
2. Generate usage instructions
3. Update compatibility matrix
4. Archive review results

## Quality Gates
- **Minimum Completeness Score**: 6/10 to be included in distribution
- **Documentation Required**: All workflows must have basic usage instructions
- **Hardware Requirements**: Must be clearly specified
- **Test Results**: Functional testing required for score > 8
