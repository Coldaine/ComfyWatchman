ComfyWatchman provides **Python APIs and tools designed for AI agents** to analyze ComfyUI workflows, identify missing models, search across multiple sources (Civitai, HuggingFace), and automatically download dependencies.

**🤖 Built for AI Agents** - Not a standalone CLI tool for end users. ComfyWatchman is a library of callable functions that AI agents (like Claude, ChatGPT, or custom automation) invoke to manage ComfyUI workflows programmatically.

**🔗 Designed to complement [ComfyUI-Copilot](https://github.com/AIDC-AI/ComfyUI-Copilot)** - While Copilot excels at workflow generation and interactive debugging, ComfyWatchman provides superior dependency management and multi-backend search as callable tools.

**✨ Key Features:**
- 🤖 **Agent-Callable APIs** - Python functions designed for AI agents to invoke
- 🔍 **Workflow Analysis Tools** - Parse ComfyUI JSON and extract model dependencies
- 🔎 **Multi-Backend Search** - Civitai + HuggingFace + Qwen AI agent
- 📥 **Automatic Downloads** - Download models with SHA256 verification and retry logic
- 🎯 **Granular Control** - Agents decide when to scan, search, or download
- 📊 **Structured Returns** - All functions return JSON/dataclass results for agent decision-making
- 🔧 **DirectID Backend** - Known model lookup database for instant resolution
- 🧠 **Embedding Awareness** - Detects textual inversion references and queues them automatically
- 🕒 **Guardrailed Scheduler** - Optional background automation with GPU VRAM safety checks
- 🔌 **Integration Ready** - Adapters for ComfyUI-Copilot and other tools

## 🚀 Quick Start for AI Agents

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/comfywatchman.git
cd comfywatchman

# Install all dependencies
uv sync

# Or, to include development dependencies:
uv sync --extra dev
```

### Agent Usage Example

```python
from comfywatchman.scanner import WorkflowScanner
from comfywatchman.search import ModelSearch
from comfywatchman.civitai_tools.direct_downloader import CivitaiDirectDownloader

# Agent calls these functions as needed:

# 1. Scan a workflow
scanner = WorkflowScanner()
models = scanner.extract_models_from_workflow("workflow.json")

# 2. Search for a missing model (now with Qwen intelligence)
search = ModelSearch()
result = search.search_model({"filename": "rife49.pth"})  # Automatically detects HuggingFace model

# 3. Download if found
if result.status == "FOUND":
    if result.source == "civitai":
        downloader = CivitaiDirectDownloader()
        download_result = downloader.download_by_id(
            result.civitai_id,
            result.version_id
        )
    elif result.source == "huggingface":
        # New: HuggingFace download support
        hf_downloader = HuggingFaceDownloader()
        download_result = hf_downloader.download_from_repo(
            result.repo_name,
            result.file_path
        )
elif result.status == "UNCERTAIN":
    # New: Handle uncertain matches with human review
    print(f"Multiple candidates found for {result.filename}")
    for candidate in result.candidates:
        print(f"- {candidate['source']}: {candidate['name']} (confidence: {candidate['match_score']})")
```

### Configuration

Set environment variables for API access:

```bash
export CIVITAI_API_KEY="your-api-key"
export COMFYUI_ROOT="/path/to/comfyui"
export HF_TOKEN="your-huggingface-token"  # Optional
```

### New Qwen Search Features

ComfyWatchman now includes advanced AI-powered search capabilities:

#### 🤖 Qwen Agentic Search
- **Intelligent Pattern Recognition**: Automatically detects model types and sources from filenames
- **Multi-Phase Search Strategy**: Civitai API → Web Search → HuggingFace verification
- **Exact Filename Validation**: Prevents downloading wrong models with strict matching

#### 🔍 Smart Pattern Recognition
The system recognizes common model patterns:
- `rife*.pth` → Frame interpolation models (HuggingFace)
- `sam_*.pth` → Facebook SAM models (HuggingFace)
- `*.safetensors` → Checkpoints (Civitai primary)
- `*.pt` → Various model types with context-aware routing

#### 🌐 Web search via Qwen
When Civitai doesn't have exact matches, the system:
- Uses Qwen's built-in web_search tool to search HuggingFace and GitHub
- Extracts repository information from search results
- Verifies file existence before download
- Provides confidence scoring for uncertain matches

#### 🔐 Hash-Based Fallback
For models already downloaded locally:
- Calculates SHA256 hashes
- Uses hash lookup for model identification
- Enables identification without known filenames

#### ✅ Enhanced Filename Validation
Early detection and rejection of invalid filenames:
- URL parameters (`?modelVersionId=123`)
- Invalid characters and special symbols
- Prevents wasted API calls on malformed inputs

### Current Roadmap Status (October 2025)

We are actively executing **Phase 1: Strengthen Core** from the three-phase roadmap in `docs/CROSSROADS.md`.

- ✅ Completed: consolidated Python package (`src/comfywatchman`), unified CLI (`comfywatchman` command), agentic search pipeline (Qwen → Civitai → web fallback), state-backed download manager, and TOML/env-based configuration.
- 🔄 In Progress: documentation polish and developer onboarding materials (this README + `docs/` refresh), packaging cleanup for PyPI, and CLI ergonomics.
- ⏳ Not Yet Started (Phase 1 items): external plugin API surface, optional telemetry hooks, extended integration examples.

Phase 2 (optimization layer) and Phase 3 (ecosystem integrations) remain future work; no engineering has begun on those tracks yet.

## 📋 Requirements

**Required:**

- Python 3.12+
- Civitai API key (free account)
- ComfyUI installation

**Optional:**

- HuggingFace token (for private models)
- Qwen CLI (for agentic search - recommended)

## 🔧 How AI Agents Use It

AI agents call ComfyWatchman functions to manage ComfyUI workflows:

1. **Scan** - `scanner.extract_models_from_workflow()` → Returns list of model dependencies
2. **Search** - `search.search_model(model_info)` → Returns SearchResult with download URL
3. **Download** - `downloader.download_by_id(civitai_id)` → Downloads and verifies model
4. **Inventory** - `inventory.build_inventory()` → Lists locally available models

Agents make decisions based on structured returns (SearchResult, DownloadResult, etc.) and invoke only the tools they need.

## 🎯 Use Cases

- **AI Agent Assistants** - Claude/ChatGPT helping users set up ComfyUI workflows
- **Automated Pipelines** - Bots that analyze and prepare workflows automatically
- **Workflow Validation** - Agents checking if workflows will run before execution
- **Dependency Resolution** - Tools that automatically fix missing model issues
- **MCP Servers** - Model Context Protocol servers exposing these tools
